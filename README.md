# Exploring Student Performance: Basic Data Analysis and Visualization

This project performs basic data analysis and visualization on a hypothetical student performance dataset using Python. It demonstrates fundamental data science concepts such as summary statistics, correlation analysis, and data visualization.

## Project Description
The dataset represents student academic performance with variables including:
- StudyHours
- PreviousScore
- FinalExamGrade

The goal of this project is to understand the relationship between study hours and final exam performance through statistical analysis and visual exploration.

## Tasks Covered
- Dataset generation with at least 100 records
- Summary statistics calculation (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Missing value check
- Pearson correlation analysis
- Data visualization using plots

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Files Included
- `student_performance_analysis.py` – Complete and runnable Python script for analysis

## How to Run the Project
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python student_performance_analysis.py

Output

Printed summary statistics and correlation results in the console

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how basic data analysis and visualization techniques can be applied to understand relationships within a dataset. It reinforces core concepts such as central tendency, dispersion, and correlation in a practical data science workflow.
